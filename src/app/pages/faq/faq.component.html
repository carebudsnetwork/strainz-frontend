              How does the marketplace work?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>Growers place their plants on the <a routerLink="/marketplace/strainz">marketplace</a> at a price they set and buyers have the option of purchasing the plant.</li>
            <li>The prices are entirely set by the selling grower</li>
            <li>There is an additional tax of 10% STRAINZ <img src="assets/budz.png" class="budz"> on the sellerâ€™s profits from sale, which are burned and encourage growers.</li>
          </ul>

              Can I harvest my plants if they are on the marketplace?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>No, you will need to take your plant off the market to harvest and water it.</li>
            <li>After this, you can list it again.</li>
          </ul>

              Where's my plant?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>If you purchased or listed a plant in the <a routerLink="/marketplace/strainz">marketplace</a>, this can happen if public Binance Smart Chain Nodes have issues, they will show up after some time!
          You can also try refreshing your browser and clearing the cache.</p>

              Can I delist my plant once it is on the marketplace?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes! Once the plant is on the <a routerLink="/marketplace/strainz">marketplace</a>, you can go to your wallet and delist it.</li>
            <li>This will incur a gas fee similar to listing it.</li>

              Why is my growth rate lower than max rate?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>Your growth rate will lower daily, as the plants need to be watered, or else growth rate will steadily decrease to a minimum of 10%.</li>
            <li>Watering plants will return the growth rate back to the max rate.</li>
            <li>When you harvest your crops, they will also be watered, with a small <img src="assets/budz.png" class="budz"> fee.</li>
            <li>STRAINZ <img src="assets/budz.png" class="budz"> tokens will be consumed based on how many plants are in your wallet to tax whales heavier.</li>

              If I breed two plants, what will the child's growth rate be?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>In V3, the growth rate of the child plant is always calculated as follows: </p>
          <p> ((Plant 1 + Plant 2)/2)*.75 </p>
          <p> This means that the respective child plant always has 75% of the average daily growth rate of the parents. </p>

              What do accessories do?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase growth rate.</li>
            <li>Joints boost growth rate by 75.</li>
            <li>Sunglasses boost growth rate by 50.</li>
            <li>Earrings boost growth rate by 35.</li>
            <li>If both plant parents breed and have their accessories along with an average growth rate of 193 and breeding fertilizer is consumed at time of breeding, the child plant will have the accessory the parents had attached.
            </li>
            <li>You can buy them from the Accessory section of the <a routerLink="/marketplace/accessoires">marketplace</a></li>

              What does fertilizer do?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>Fertilizer will increase a plants growth rate significantly for 7 days. You will need to burn SEEDZ <img src="assets/seedz.png" class="budz"> to buy it.</p>

              What are SEEDZ?
            </mat-panel-title>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
            <li>SEEDZ <img src="assets/seedz.png" class="budz"> are STRAINZ <img src="assets/budz.png" class="budz"> cousins tokens, and can be used to buy fertilizer for plants (More use cases are planned!).</li>
            <li>They can be purchased at the on <a href="https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&outputCurrency=0x789597a72aff54fadea196c13fa1011c2e3c2a1e">PancakeSwap</a>, but only with STRAINZ <img src="assets/budz.png" class="budz"></li>
            <li>You can also farm SEEDZ <img src="assets/seedz.png" class="budz"> with the STRAINZ/BNB or STRAINZ/SEEDZ <a routerLink="/stake">Farms</a></li>
